## What Developer Skills are Needed?

The curriculum for MediaShelf's annual HydraCamp reflects the skills that a Hydra development team should ideally have. They should be able to:

-   build a Rails3 Application with RSpec & Capybara tests and track it in Git
-   work with MVC, Rails Plugins, Git workflow, and be able to write good tickets
-   model & create Fedora objects with XML & RDF metadata then index them in Solr
-   use Blacklight to build a customized Solr-driven search/discovery interface
-   build a user interface for creating and editing Fedora objects

## Where Can Developers Get Training?

The community offers multi-day public HydraCamps at least once a year in North America. Additional single and half-day workshops are frequently offered in conjunction with other major Library and Library Technology Conferences. HydraCamps are typically facilitated by Data Curation Experts who can also be engaged for private HydraCamp events or custom training engagements. Contact Information is available at [http://curationexperts.com](http://curationexperts.com)

## Tickets: Reporting Bugs & Requesting Features

We use Github, issues as our project tracker. Please report issues against the git repository for the specific gem you are having issues with. If you are unable to identify the gem in which your problem is occurring, please e-mail the **hydra-tech@googlegroups.com** mailing list to help narrow your issue.
