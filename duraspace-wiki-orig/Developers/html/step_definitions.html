                           <p>logged in as "username"<br>
ie logged in as "an archivist"</p>

<p>with "create collection" permission</p>

<p>I should see a new "admin set" object</p>
<ul>
  <li>defines a set of behaviors</li>
</ul>


<p>should have a radio box – not sure what this should look like</p>

<p>when I discard the <br>
and I confirm in an dialog box<br>
then xxx is no longer accessible for<br>
the xxx can only be retrieved by xxx – needs to wait for permissions work</p>



<p>this xxx information is autosaved</p>

<p>I should see xx link<br>
when I clikc on xxx link</p>
