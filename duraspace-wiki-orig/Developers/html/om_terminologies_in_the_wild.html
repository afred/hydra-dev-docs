                           <p>Hydra has released a Hydra Head tutorial. As you step through the tutorial it actually builds a hydra head on your local machine.</p>

<p>In more detail, the tutorial:</p>

<ul>
  <li>installs basic application prerequisites</li>
  <li>generates a new rails application</li>
  <li>walks through building a Hydra model:
  <ul>
    <li>first, as a AF::Base object with an XML datastream</li>
    <li>then, with a simple OM terminology for a basic, contrived schema</li>
    <li>finally, with a simple MODS-based terminology</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>wires the model into Rails using standard Rails scaffolding</li>
  <li>adds blacklight and hydra-head gems for object discovery</li>
  <li>adds a basic rspec/capybara test</li>
</ul>


<p>Throughout the process, there are a number of prompts to poke around the rails console and/or in a browser. At the end of the tutorial, you have a working Hydra Head for adding MODS-based metadata records.</p>

<p>The tutorial can be found in the projecthydra git repository: <a href="https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-tutorial" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-tutorial</a></p>

<p>and it is a simple as</p>

<p>$ gem install hydra-tutorial</p>

<p>$ hydra-tutorial</p>

<p>…to get going! Many thanks to Chris Beer for this wonderful addition to Hydra’s armoury.</p>
