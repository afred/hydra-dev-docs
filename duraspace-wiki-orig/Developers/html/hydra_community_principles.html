The current testing infrastructure is RSpec for everything but Rails views, and Cucumber for for Rails views.</li><li>Tests must be committed at the same time code is.</li><li>All javascript features (where feasible) should be added using “progressive enhancement” or “unobtrusive javascript” styles. Meaning the basic feature should work without Javascript, and the JS should be added as a progressive enhancement, and added via externally linked js files, not in-line in html source as script tags, onclick attributes, etc.</li><li>All bugs and development tasks will be tracked in JIRA</li><li>All code must be documented before it’s committed</li></ul><p><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="HydraCommunityPrinciples-getwhatyougive"></span> You get what you give</p><ol><li>Hydra institutions commit to porting good functionality back to core. When implementing new functionality, try to do it in ways that lend themselves to re-use in other Hydra heads. When you set out to create new functionality, provision resources for contributing back.</li><li>What to expect from the community... Where to find extra help...</li></ol><p>New Hydra heads should be posted as a publicly accessible showcase (either screencasts walking through novel features or publicly accessible demo with sample content and sample accounts with edit/admin permission)</p>
