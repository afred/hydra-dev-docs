                           <h3 id="HydraCommunityTrainingPlan-GoalsandObjectives">Goals and Objectives</h3><p>In order to support a vibrant and growing community of adopters, the Hydra community needs to ensure that sufficient training exists to help new adopters get up to speed on Hydra. &nbsp;This training definitely needs to address brining new developers onboard, but over time we hope to address others in the Hydra ecosystem as well: curators and archivists, operations staff, project managers, etc.</p><h3 id="HydraCommunityTrainingPlan-TrainingAreas">Training Areas</h3><ul><li>Planning a Hydra deployment for non-developers</li><li>Sustaining a hydra installation (for operations folk)</li><li>Technical training<br><ul><li>Getting Started</li><li>Models &amp; metadata</li><li>Rights management</li><li>Multimedia issues</li><li>Discovery</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="HydraCommunityTrainingPlan-TechnicalTraining">Technical Training</h3><p>We offer training in a variety of contexts from online training like the hydra and blacklight tutorials to full-blown 5 day HydraCamps. &nbsp;In between, we have a number of training contexts (such as the Code4Lib pre-conferenece sessions) that allow us to offer half- or full-day training sessions that focus on a specific topic.</p><p>By adopting a strategy of making the training modular and loosely coupled, we have the opportunity to use the same curriculum in multiple contexts - online, half-day, full-day, and HydraCamp. &nbsp;In this structure, we might have the following half-day modules:</p><ul><li>Intro to Rails programming (leverages Railsbridge / rails for zombies / ??? )</li><li>Intro to Hydra (leverages hydra tutorial)</li><li>Intro to Blacklight (leverages blacklight tutorial)</li><li>Collaborative development processes (new content addressing Agile, Distributed Source Control, Ticket/Story management, group decision process)</li><li>Test Driven Development (new content - looking for a good resource here - need to check out the quickly generated list below)<br><ul><li><a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html</a></li><li><a href="http://www.rubyfocus.biz/class_video/2010/07/19/rails_tdd_class_1.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://www.rubyfocus.biz/class_video/2010/07/19/rails_tdd_class_1.html</a></li><li><a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html</a></li><li><a href="http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html</a></li></ul></li><li>Content and Metadata models (new content - how to get it right without getting mired down)</li><li>Rights Management (new content)</li><li>Server Architecture and Deployment Management (new content)</li></ul><p>Each of these sessions should be sized for a half or full day session that could be offered individually or in groups at events like Code4Lib or OR.</p><p>Then, you could offer a HydraCamp that leverages these modules while also giving the opportunity to do more hands-on, exploratory learning. &nbsp;Hydra-camp could offer participants the opportunity to build a full fledged repository / Hydra-head that manages text, image, or generic (small) file content. &nbsp;Mornings would be spent covering the content in one of the individual modules and afternoons would be spent in team-based hack-fest style collaboration on an actual repository that students could use as a starting point when the go home to their respective institutions. &nbsp;</p><p>A possible outline might look like this:</p><p><strong>HydraCamp</strong></p><ul><li>Day 1 - Intro to Rails (AM) | Collaborative Dev Processes (PM)</li><li>Day 2 - Intro to Hydra (AM) | Build your own basic Repo (PM)</li><li>Day 3 - Content Modeling (AM) | Build out your own content model &amp; Ingest data (PM)</li><li>Day 4 - Intro to Blacklight (AM) | Build your own discover Interface (PM)</li><li>Day 5 - Student Choice (AM) - class votes on Intro to TD or Rights Management or Deployment Management | Travel &amp; small group sessions (PM)</li></ul><p>We need to find a way to give students a sense of a continuous flow through the various morning sessions, so thinking about giving a good overview on day 1 and providing appropriate transitional material in the afternoons that helps link the modules (which are designed to be stand-alone) that students cover in the morning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="HydraCommunityTrainingPlan-To-Do's">To-Do's</h3><ul><li>Finalize the modules and order to be used in HydraCamp (Mark and Justin can give this a Dry-run in Dublin)</li><li>Find content suitable to seed HydraCamp roll-your-own repos (probably 10 items each with metadata)<br><ul><li>Text / PDF</li><li>Images</li><li>Generic File Repo (i.e. Sufia / ScholarSphere)</li></ul></li><li>Think about how much we want to try to tackle Collaborative Development and TDD - Mark thinks these are really important topics to participate successfully in the HydraCommunity, but also some of the harder topics to teach.</li><li>Incorporate feedback from Code4Lib pre-conference retrospective into all of the above</li><li>Finalize one or more of the training modules to post-online and add to they Hydra-Wiki developer training section</li><li>(Optional) send out survey to past HydraCamp participants and get feedback</li><li>(Optional) send out survey to current Hydra Partners asking where they percieve gaps in available training - do they have what they need to bring new developers up to speed, etc.?</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
