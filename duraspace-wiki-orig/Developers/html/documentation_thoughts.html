<p>look at Islandora user documentation</p>


<p>what is the hydra stack?</p>

<p>how is hydra different from a rails app</p>

<p>how do I know whether or not I'm making a hydra-head</p>

<p>"each piece is pretty clear, it's just when you put them into the stack that makes it fuzzy"</p>

<p>how do we make documentation simple?<br>
high level<br>
each component</p>

<p>when we say "it might be this, it might be that" it becomes much harder to explain</p>

<p>"hierarchy of promises" - what does each piece do for us?</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Solr</span></strong></p>


<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fedora</span></strong></p>


<p>We never interact  directly with filesystem, we use Fedora.</p>

<p>Fedora provides these pieces that <strong>we actually use</strong> (remove extraneous information)</p>


<p>document:  comparing Fedora to Microservices<br>
microservices is the next generation design of Fedora, sort of.  Michael Giarlo is interested as of 2012</p>


<p>"How Hydra uses Fedora"  &lt;-- not a "promise"</p>

<p>document - how you might leverage other parts of Fedora</p>


<p>SQL database and triplestore - not really relevant</p>

<p>Solr ..  it's our search index, and lets us do facets</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hydra-Jetty</span></strong></p>


<p>Hydra-Jetty - gives us a copy of jetty with solr/fedora set up<br>
addl doc:  how you can install these pieces into the web service of your choice (links out)<br>
addl doc:  how to set up a production web server(s) with these pieces</p>


<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rubydora</span></strong></p>


<p>Rubydora - ruby way to talk to fedora rest api<br>
"is it a gem?"</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ActiveFedora</span></strong></p>


<p>ActiveFedora - a way to work with fedora models as easily as sql models in rails<br>
object-relational mapping to fedora<br>
you can do the equivalent of modeling/creating schema for  database tables</p>

<p>also affects how you index things into solr.<br>
how else can this be done (to clarify what is being done with the example)?</p>

<p>if content has xml datastreams ...<br>
then you're just dealing with xml that could have come from anywhere</p>

<p>"active-fedora uses om pretty centrally"</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OM</span></strong></p>


<p>OM a way to have a DSL to map xml into solr field stuff<br>
simplifying way to manipulate xml<br>
perhaps I should try skipping it and using nokogiri<br>
is a way to parse xml into ..</p>

<p>nokogiri, libxml, libxslt  --&gt;  you can always go down to this level and skip the DSL part</p>

<p>OM implies talking to Solr – "currently a convenience thing we could still split off"<br>
"is it a gem" ?</p>


<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Solrizer</span></strong></p>


<p>way to get stuff into solr<br>
gives you a basic api interface for connecting to Solr<br>
you can index an object<br>
you can index all the known objects<br>
create the solr document for this given object</p>

<p>it could get the info from fedora, an xml file, a spreadsheet ...</p>

<p>provides a "to_solr" method for OM docs:<br>
"if you've got an OM terminology, then Solrizer knows what to do with it"<br>
you can override or extend this</p>

<p>Solrizer itself doesn't do anything - b/c the input to Solrizer link isn't there</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Solrizer-Fedora</span></strong><br>
the fedora specific implementation, so Fedora is the source of the data going in to Solr</p>


<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">JettyWrapper</span></strong><br>
to use the hydra jetty,<br>
start, stop, use hydra jetty in your test suite</p>

<p>Jetty is a peer of tomcat;  it's a java web application server</p>


<p>Hydra-Cmodels<br>
can be used in and of themselves.</p>


<p>All of the above is independent of rails.</p>

<p>"I don't know if the application I'm building is a hydra head"<br>
"I'm interested in using Hydra pieces"<br>
"Do I need to use the whole stack to get the benefits?"<br>
"If I don't use the whole stack, am I using Hydra?"<br>
"How can folks using pieces of the Hydra stack be a part of the community"<br>
some folks just use hydra cmodels<br>
some folks use pieces of the stack, but not the whole stack</p>

<p>"How would somebody take these things and use them differently?"  (examples!)<br>
"which pieces require other pieces"</p>

<p>"Hierarchy of Promises" document is:<br>
an architectural vision<br>
a way to look at the stack to determine how we <strong>should</strong> develop the architecture</p>



<p>"Now for the Controversal part"</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ruby on Rails</span></strong></p>


<p>Ruby on Rails is a way to develop a web application MVC<br>
Can I use the stack without a Rails app?<br>
Can I use the stack without a Ruby app?<br>
M - rails + active-model<br>
V - rails<br>
C - rails<br>
rails gets better and better:  authentication, engines, ...</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blacklight:</span></strong><br>
if you have stuff in Solr, you can use Blacklight as a read-only (search and discovery) application to your solr index<br>
it accommodates heterogenous types of objects</p>

<p>"Each hydra-head has a blacklight for search and discovery"</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HydraHead</span></strong></p>


<p>HydraHead - all other application logic needed for hydra head<br>
AssetsController - deprecated<br>
CatalogController - deprecated (the <strong>hydra</strong> catalog controller - make a rails controller)<br>
"how/why do i do a controller?"<br>
Access Controls - gated discovery, CRUD, granularity   &lt;-- could be its own gem - useful outside of rails<br>
"what do these do?  how does it work?"<br>
this is in fedora object, but the app uses it from Solr.<br>
Official Hydra Object Datastreams and Models</p>
<ul class="alternate">
  <li>are the types on the wiki STILL the right types?</li>
  <li>this code is not really set up for the way we're moving towards with models</li>
</ul>


<p>"does the hydra plugin imply a dependency on fedora?  yes!  if you use hydrahead without fedora, it will blow up"</p>

<p>assumes AF, OM, Solr, Fedora ...<br>
does NOT assume HydraJetty, or JettyWrapper</p>

<p>Hydra is slanted towards mods</p>

<p>MODS datastream models and so on is provided – has this worn out its welcome as an expectation that is coded in<br>
"Can I use views if I don't use mods?"</p>

<p>FileAssets and datastreams<br>
how do you find the actual content?<br>
how is this exposed in blacklight and in hyhead</p>

<p>Views:<br>
Submission Workflow - multi-step construction of objects?   any thing besides object construction?<br>
Mods Submission Workflow – should this just be an exemplar?<br>
UI/Layout<br>
Javascript - allows workflow to be shown as a single page; auto-save; customization of jquery date-picker<br>
here is where "is it a framework or application" becomes troublesome</p>

<p>UI:<br>
Testability<br>
Accessability</p>

<p>Tension:  hydra out of the box is something  but  should we be providing views?<br>
should submission workflow be a separate gem?  etc.</p>


<p>Can use Blacklight + AF if you don't want editing<br>
Can't use HydraHead without<br>
Chart:  If you use xxx, then you must use yyy</p>

<p>Poll - who uses which pieces?  What versions of those pieces?</p>


<p>Your local rails app - blah blah</p>


<p>Which pieces are plugins vs. not?  (Blacklight is a plugin)</p>



<p>What would be easy for people to pick up?  What should be in "HydraHead"?  What should be in "Hydra"?</p>




<p>example models:<br>
Active-Fedora: sample models and objects with tests in spec directory  (AF approach)<br>
Hydra-Head:<br>
official object and datastream models - should be in its own gem?  in HydraHead?</p>


<p>random notes:</p>

<p>split out AccessControls so you can apply them to Blacklight (without Hydra)<br>
"how can i use submission workflow"</p>
