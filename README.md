# Hydra Developer Documentation
This project was started as an effort to refactor developer documentation for Project Hydra.


### Objectives
Several areas for improvement were identified at the Hydra Partners meeting at Stanford in March 2013. These include:

- Update list of knowledge required
- Identify and nuke stale docs
- Version docs with code
- (?) Have own repository for documentation
- Tips, pointers, best practices
- Migrate developer documentation from Duraspace to git hub
  - communicate the move
  - request time boxed approval
- Documentation audit and automation at Boston mtg (1/2 day)
- Module of what I need to know as a manager

### The github wiki
The wiki for this repo was cloned from https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/wiki. We'll use that as the refactoring space for the hydra-head wiki. Once we are satisfied, we can rebase, squashing commits as necessary, and push back to https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/wiki.
