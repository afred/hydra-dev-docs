# Hydra Developer Documentation
This project was started as an effort to refactor developer documentation for Project Hydra.

Several areas for improvement were identified at the Hydra Partners meeting at Stanford in March 2013. These include:

- Update list of knowledge required
- Identify and nuke stale docs
- Version docs with code
- (?) Have own repository for documentation
- Tips, pointers, best practices
- Migrate developer documentation from Duraspace to git hub
  - communicate the move
  - request time boxed approval
- Documentation audit and automation at Boston mtg (1/2 day)
- Module of what I need to know as a manager
