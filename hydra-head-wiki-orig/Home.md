# Hydra Head Developer Wiki

Hydra-Head is a Ruby on Rails engine. It is part of the [Hydra framework](http://projecthydra.org) and provides tools, patterns and common utilities for creating a web application on top of content in a [Fedora](http://fedora-commons.org) repository.

This wiki is targeted towards developers who are implementing Hydra Heads. The [Duraspace wiki](http://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/) has information discussing the Hydra architecture. There's also information for new and potential adopters on the [project web site](http://projecthydra.org).
