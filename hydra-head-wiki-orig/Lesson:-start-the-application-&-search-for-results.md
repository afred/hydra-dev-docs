This lesson is known to work with hydra-head version 6.0.0.   
_Please update this wiki to reflect any other versions that have been tested._

# Goals
* Start and Stop a local "development" copy of the application
* Remove the default Welcome page provided by Rails
* Run a Search in Blacklight through your browser

# Steps

### Step 1: Start the Rails server

Now, let's see our model on the web.  You can start 'webrick', a development server that comes with rails by typing:

```bash
$> rails server
```

Leave that terminal window open.  It will print info whenever the server does anything.  You will return to this window when you want to stop or restart the server.

### Step 2: Look at the application in your Browser

Now you can visit your local copy of the application with a web browser when you point the browser at [[http://localhost:3000/]]

If it worked you should see a page with the text: "Welcome aboard. Youâ€™re riding Ruby on Rails!".  This is the default page, but now that we know it works, we can delete it.  

### Step 3: Remove the Rails default "Welcome" page

Open a new terminal (so we can keep the server running) and type:

```bash
$> rm public/index.html
```
Then reload the page at [[http://localhost:3000/]].  

### Step 4: Run a Search

Now that you've removed the default "Welcome" page and reloaded the page in your browser, you should see something that looks like a default Blacklight install.  If you enter a search query you don't see any results because we haven't created any objects yet -- your Solr index is empty.

In the next step we will create a Book object that will then show up in your search results.
